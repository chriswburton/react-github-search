# React / Redux / Redux Observable - Example Code Project

> Example code for a simple Github live user search feature built with React.

Epics with 'Redux Observable' are the icing on the cake in this project. They provide a great way to bring the asynchronous power of RxJS to the React/Redux architecture.

Simply put: Epics are streams of 'Actions in' -> 'Actions out!'. It's a really fantastic and useful combination.
